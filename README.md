# Credit-default-prediction
## Overview
This project focuses on building an internal credit scoring system based on historical banking data. The primary objective is to predict whether a company will be able to repay a loan, aiding in risk assessment and decision-making.

## Project Structure
**Data Preprocessing:**

The dataset, comprising historical banking information, is processed and cleaned.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the dataset.

**Feature Engineering:**

Key features are identified, and new features are created to enhance model performance.
Date-time features are analyzed, cleaned, and transformed as needed.

**Modeling:**

Selected models for credit default prediction include logistic regression, decision tree, and linear discriminant analysis.
Feature selection techniques such as Stepwise and Sequential Feature Selector are employed.

**Handling Imbalanced Data:**

Techniques for addressing imbalanced classes are applied to improve model robustness.

**Model Evaluation:**

Model performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, and AUC-ROC curve.

**Results and Insights:**

Detailed analysis of model performances for each chosen algorithm.
Interpretations of the results and key takeaways.

**Future Perspectives:**

Recommendations for further improvements, including in-depth variable exploration and data enrichment.
Suggestions for advanced modeling techniques, such as neural networks.

**Conclusion:**

Summary of project findings, showcasing the model's ability to discriminate between loan repayments and defaults.
Establishing a foundation for decision-making in the financial domain.
